# Introduction

A close friend of mine has recently decided to change his career path and has decided to do a Computer Science conversion Masters from his original
undergraduate of English Literature. 

I was recently trying to help him understand what REST is, how it works and why it's used for most modern APIs and realised that there's very few
resources that help people conceptually understand this at a high level. Most resources either dig into the technical details of the topic very early on, 
vaguely scratch the surface of the topic without really explaining anything or have horrible formatting and are completely filled with obnoxious ads.

In this article I try to explain the REST framework, its value and the context around it in the way I would explain it to a beginner. In effect I attempt
to teach the beginner enough to be dangerous.
