# Introduction

With the increasing occurrence of high-profile cybersecurity breaches such as those for JBS[1] and Colonial Pipeline[2], 
security of public user data is arguably more important than ever. Most major breaches occur through human error such as through 
accidental leakage of authentication details or through a vulnerability at a technology supplier (ie SolarWinds[3]).

In this article I explore how authentication management works with Google Cloud Functions and how this can be utilised to achieve an effective
balance of security and convenience.

# Authentication Setup

Authentication for Google Cloud Functions is handled through the **IAM** (Identity and Access Management)[4], Google describes this as 
_"Fine-grained access control and visibility for centrally managing cloud resources"_.

The authentication mechanism reminds me quite a bit to that OpenShift, it heavily involves **Service Accounts** and **Rolebindings**
- The administrator can do anything to a cloud function, this includes creating, updating, and deleting them.
- The administrator can add **'members'** to a function, these are identified by their user or service account email.
- The administrator can create specific **'roles'** that define the actions that members/identities with the role are allowed to do[5].]
    - Members/Identities can then be granted the appropriate IAM roles for specific functions/projects.
    - The granted roles also define which _resources_ the member has access to (ie organisations, projects, Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) clusters, and Cloud Storage buckets).

## Granularity

By default, permissions are provided at _function level_ however different permission granularity can be set up (ie at _project level_).

You can also disable authentication requirements[6] when invoking specific functions or even when invoking any function for a given project,
this is **strongly inadvised** however and should only be done when running quick tests for test functionality that has no access to real data.

# HTTP Function Invocation

- By default, all HTTP Cloud Functions have an automatically provisioned TLS certificate so secure connections can be established.
- By default, all HTTP functions require for the invokers to be authenticated.
- Unauthenticated functions can be set up for debugging and fast testing/iteration purposes by using the _'--allow-unauthenticated'_ flag[7].
    - Only the members with the **Owner** and **Cloud Functions Admin** roles can set the flag.
    - Once the flag is set, the **'call'** CLI command can be used to directly invoke a function[8].
    - The 'call' command lets you directly supply data as the body/payload of a POST REST request to the function so that you can review the function's behaviour.
    - To ensure that user data remains secure, Google Cloud ensures there is an _un-overrideable quota_ on how many unauthorised requests can be done per month. This helps ensure the feature
    is _not_ used in production[9].
- CORS is managed by https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/writing/http#handling_cors_requests

# Event-driven Function Invocation

- Event-driven functions (also known as 'Background Functions') can only handle events triggered from within the Cloud Infrastructure or triggered manually.
    - A cloud project has a distributed and automatically scalable Pub/Sub message bus. You can set up Pub/Sup topics for the project that functions can Publish/Subscribe to.
- The payload of a message is stored as a base64-encoded string in the 'data' attribute of the message, this needs to be decoded prior to use.
- By default, Background 'Functions acks incoming Pub/Sub messages internally upon function invocation'
- The automated acknowledgements don't occur if automatic retrying of failed invocations is enabled.
- There are 2 ways to manually trigger a Background Function:
    - The Production way: Run a CURL or general HTTP POST request to _https://GCF_REGION-GCP_PROJECT_ID.cloudfunctions.net/publish_ with the event data as payload. 
    This is fairly secure as the message is parsed, processed and published through function's in-build 'publish' function.
    - The insecure Test/Debug method involving using the **gcloud functions call** command. This lets you use the _gcloud_ CLI to directly create and edit topics as well as deploy
    and invoke functions[10].

Types of role-bindings:

https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/writing/background 

IAM Policies:

An IAM policy is a set of role-bindings attached to a resource. It's effectively a collection of all the access control defined for a resource. 
An IAM Policy's controls/role-bindings apply hierarchically:
    - The hierarchy is: _Organisation_ -> _Folders_ -> _Projects_ (can also be a direct child of an organisation) -> _Resources_ (for a service).
    - Anything applied to a parent node applies to all its child nodes.

# In-Built Cybersecurity Protections

- Data is encrypted at rest (when stored at a Google Cloud facility). [Find Google's relevant white-paper here](https://cloud.google.com/security/encryption/default-encryption/)
    - Stored data is split into chunks with each chunk being encrypted with a different unique encryption key.
    - Encryption keys are exclusively stored in _Google's Key Manamagent Service_.
    - Most data is encrypted using **AES256**.
    - Encryption is consistently done using the **Tink** cryptographic library, code changes to this are tightly controlled.
- Data is encrypted when in transit between Google facilities. [Find Google's relevant white-paper here](https://cloud.google.com/security/encryption-in-transit?skip_cache=true)
    - When data is in transit within areas physically controlled by Google, data is authenticated but not always encrypted.
    - When data is in transit through areas not physically controlled by Google, data is both authenticated and encrypted.
    - Encryption is done at one or more network layers.
    - Specific protections differ however some default protection involves using TLS encryption.
    - Further in-transit encryption is available for specific use cases (ie SMTP servers). 
- Compliance with both UK and US regulations such as HIPAA, GDPR, and CCPA is constantly and automatically kept without user involvement.[11]
- Infrastructure is _'secure-by-design'_. This involves:
    - In-built protections against denial of service attacks[12].
        - A feature called _'Google Cloud Armor'_ comes integrated into the Cloud Load Balancing service. This can scale to absorb massive DDoS attacks.
    - Infrastructure software is monitored for threats **24/7**.
    - Data centers used include physical security such as _'safeguards 
    like custom-designed electronic access cards, alarms, vehicle access barriers, 
    perimeter fencing, metal detectors, and biometrics, and the data center floor features laser beam intrusion detection.'_[13].
- Strong authentication requirements with Security Keys that have 2FA support.
- No trust is assumed between deployed services, _Service, Machine and Employee Accounts_ and _Service Whitelists_ amongst others are used for approval. 
This access restriction is automatically enforced, in effect a 'multi-tentant' model is followed.

# Cybersecurity Implications For Users and Their Clients

The straightforward yet detailed cybersecurity setup for Google Cloud Functions provides a good balance of security and data privacy whilst maintaining some convenience for the developer.

That said, **both** the major previously detailed risks remain: 
- Human error could cause Service Accounts to become leaked.
- Vulnerabilities in third-party suppliers such as APIs, libraries, tools (automation, data visualisation) as well as malicious HTTP requests/events.

Overall, usage of Google Cloud for data storage and code hosting heavily reduces suceptibility to major vulnerabilities and ensures all latest data security regulations are followed. However
it is not a fool-proof measure and users need to follow cybersecurity best-practise and vet any third-party suppliers used to keep them and their clients secure.
